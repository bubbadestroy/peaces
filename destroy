The EspoTek Labrador is a crowd-funded lab-on-a-board that includes an oscilloscope, waveform generator, power supply, logic analyzer, and multimeter. I was drawn to the project specifically because it promised open hardware, and multi-platform open source software. I’m really impressed by my first tests - no trouble getting the board up and running on MacOSX. As always, all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics & Arduino Projects repo on GitHub
